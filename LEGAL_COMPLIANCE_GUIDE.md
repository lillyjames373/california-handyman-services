# California Handyman Legal Compliance Guide

This document outlines the key legal requirements and limitations for operating as a handyman in California, with specific focus on electrical, plumbing, and HVAC services. It serves as a reference for website content, service offerings, and business operations.

## Key Legal Thresholds

### The $1,000 Exemption (Effective January 1, 2025)

- California law permits unlicensed handymen to perform work valued at **less than $1,000** (including labor, materials, and other costs)
- This exemption applies **only if**:
  - The work does not require a building permit
  - No employees or subcontractors are used (solo work only)
- This is an absolute cap - cannot be circumvented by splitting jobs or separate billing

### Previous $500 Limit

- Prior to January 1, 2025, the limit was $500 per project
- References to this historical limit may still exist in online resources

## Permit Requirements

### Non-Permit Work (Generally Allowed)

#### Electrical Services Not Requiring Permits
- Replacing light fixtures (no new wiring)
- Replacing switches and outlets (no new circuits)
- Installing ceiling fans where fixtures already exist
- Repairing or replacing doorbells
- Smoke detector installation/replacement

#### Plumbing Services Not Requiring Permits
- Unclogging drains using snakes or augers
- Using camera for drain inspections
- Clearing pipe stoppages
- Removing toilets to clear clogs (without installing new fixtures)
- Repairing leaky faucets
- Replacing garbage disposals (where connections exist)

#### HVAC Services Not Requiring Permits
- Replacing thermostats (same type)
- Changing filters
- Basic maintenance
- Minor component replacement

### Permit-Required Work (Not for Handymen)

The following types of work generally require permits and therefore a licensed contractor:

- Installing new electrical circuits or wiring
- Panel upgrades or modifications
- Installing new plumbing fixtures or pipes
- Water heater replacements
- HVAC system installations
- Structural modifications
- Work that affects building egress
- Work involving gas lines

## Advertising Requirements

### Legal Disclosure Requirements

- All advertising materials (including website, business cards, flyers) **must clearly state** that you are not a licensed contractor
- Cannot use terms like "plumber," "electrician," or other regulated professional titles in advertising
- Cannot imply licensing or qualifications beyond handyman status

### Compliant Advertising Examples

- "Handyman services for small electrical and plumbing repairs (not a licensed contractor)"
- "Minor home repairs under $1,000 - Unlicensed handyman with 8 years of electrical experience"
- "Drain clearing and small electrical fixes - Not a licensed contractor"

## Job Documentation Requirements

### Estimates and Contracts

For each job, it's advisable to document:
- Detailed scope of work
- Materials list with costs
- Labor cost
- Total project cost (showing it's under $1,000)
- Statement about not being a licensed contractor
- Project start and completion dates

### Record Keeping

Maintain records of:
- All jobs performed
- Total cost of each job
- Materials used
- Before/after photos (with customer permission)
- Customer information and contact details

## Common Legal Pitfalls to Avoid

### Job Splitting (Illegal)

- Cannot artificially divide a single project into multiple jobs to stay under the $1,000 limit
- Example: Breaking a bathroom renovation into separate invoices for electrical, plumbing, etc.

### Misrepresentation

- Cannot represent yourself as a licensed contractor or tradesperson
- Cannot use language that implies licensing ("licensed," "certified," etc.)
- Cannot claim ability to perform work that requires permits

### Subcontracting

- As an unlicensed handyman using the $1,000 exemption, you cannot use employees or subcontractors
- Must perform all work personally

## Insurance Considerations

While not strictly a legal requirement for handymen, it's highly recommended to carry:
- General liability insurance
- Tools and equipment insurance
- Vehicle insurance for business use

## Referring Larger Jobs

### Establishing Licensed Contractor Relationships

- Develop relationships with licensed contractors for referrals
- Clearly document handoff process for jobs beyond legal scope
- Consider referral agreements with licensed professionals

### Liability Limitations

- Clearly communicate service limitations to customers
- Document when a job exceeds your legal scope
- Provide written recommendations when licensed work is needed
